 Q2) Explain ClassCastException with the help of the example.

	Class Cast Exception is runtype exception raised in java when we try to cast a class from one type to another.
	Example:
					
			class Bank{
				String name;
				String ifscCode;
							
				void printDetails(){
					System.out.println(this.name+this.ifscCode)
				}
			 }
					
			class Axis extends Bank{}
			class Sbi extends Bank{}

			public class Main{
						
				public static void main(String[] args){
					Bank axis = new Axis();
					Sbi sbi = new Sbi();
							
					We can create axis,sbi Object with Axis,Sbi classes and Bank reference boz Axis,Sbi classes are child classes of Bank class
					Axis axis1 = (Axis)axis;   // No problem won't throws any exception boz axis object is created with super class reference and child class object
					Bank axis2 = (Axis)axis;   // this causes the Class cast exception 							
				}
