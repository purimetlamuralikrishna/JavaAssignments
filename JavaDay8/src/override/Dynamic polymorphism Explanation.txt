Q3) Explain dynamic polymorphism ?

	Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which jvm will call to an overridden method to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. 
	It is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch. 
	We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.




	Example:
		class Student {
			String name;
			String id;
			
			void printDetails(){
				System.out.primtln("This is parent Student Class")
			}
		}

		class Student1 extends Student{
			
			@Override
			void printDetails(){
				System.out.println("This is child class Overriden Method")
			}
		}

		public class Main(){
			
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Student person = new Student1();
				person.printDetails(); // This is child class Overriden Method (This call's the override method while run time this is called dynamic polymorsphisam)
				
			}
		}
